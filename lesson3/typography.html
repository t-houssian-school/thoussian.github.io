            <p>Lato is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010
                by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in Polish).
                In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the Open Font License
                by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.
                In the last ten or so years, during which Łukasz
                has been designing type, most of his projects
                were rooted in a particular design task that
                he needed to solve. With Lato, it was no different.
                Originally, the family was conceived as a set of
                corporate fonts for a large client — who in the end
                decided to go in different stylistic direction, so the
                family became available for a public release.
